                <h2> Hobbies and Interests </h2>
                <h3> 1. Cooking </h3>
                <p> I'm an avid home cook, having spent probably 20 years in the kitchen with my dad since I was just a little kid. People ask how I got so good at cooking... I think I have a knack for it, but really, it's just all the years of practice. </p>

                <h3> 2. Golf </h3>
                <p> Another passion of mine is golf. I've played on and off since I was a kid and really got back into it with my friends now in my 20s. My favorite place to play (only partially because I get to play there for free) is the <a href="https://www.coralgables.com/department/community-recreation/granada-golf-course">Granada Golf Course</a>. </p>
                <h3> 3. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu </h3>
                <p> About three years ago, I pushed myself *way* out of my comfort zone and decided to start Brazilian jiu-jitsu as a way to get into better shape and to learn some valuable lessons. I didn't really know what to expect or how long I would stick with it, but I was pleasantly surprised that I walked away with only a (really) broken finger. </p>

                <h2> Career Goals </h2>
                <p> At the moment, I'm doing pretty well in public sector marketing and communications and have moved up from a lowly part-timer to manager in just a couple of years. I always have the option to stay on this path and keep climbing the ladder, but I've also been interested in pivoting to the agency/consulting side of public sector comms, or even jumping to private sector as a business-to-government (B2G, as opposed to B2B) marketer. Who knows what the future holds. </p>
